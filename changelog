Changelog for pyspread
======================

Note: This changelog does not comprise development of pyspread for Python2
      It starts with the first Alpha release 1.99.0.0


2.4
---

This release adds basic Exel syntax for cell code.

Dependencies:
 * Mandatory: Python (≥ 3.6), numpy (>=1.1), PyQt6 (≥ 6.5, requires PyQt6.Svg),
   setuptools (>=40.0), markdown2 (>= 2.3)
 * Recommended: matplotlib (>=1.1.1), pyenchant (>=1.1), pip (>=18),
   python-dateutil (>= 2.7.0), py-moneyed (>=2.0),
   rpy2 (>=3.4, requires R installation), plotnine (>=0.8), libvoikko (>=4.3),
   nuspell (>=5.1), hspell (>= 1.4), ggplot2 (>=3.4), pycel (>=1.0b30),
   openpyxl [extra] (>=3.0.7)
 * For building the apidocs with Sphinx see apidocs/requirements.txt

New features:
 * If a cell code starts with `=` then it is interpreted as Excel syntax
   (optional dependecy `pycel` required). Limitations of `pycel` apply.
 * New action insert and shift/delete and shift cells that shift
   below/right cells.
 * Cell formats can now be set to defaults, which allows to let a cell
   follow the OS theme, e.g. for a dark theme, the cell background of the
   black, while it may be white for the identical pys file on light theme.
 * Files can now be opened via drag 'n drop

Bug fixes:
 * Several bugs that appear with Python 3.13 fixed, e.g. printing,
   cell refrencing, grid resizing
 * The entry line is now updated on a table change
 * Globals are now cleared after initialiying the grid

2.3.1
-----

This is a bugfix release.

Dependencies:
 * Mandatory: Python (≥ 3.6), numpy (>=1.1), PyQt6 (≥ 6.5, requires PyQt6.Svg),
   setuptools (>=40.0), markdown2 (>= 2.3)
